    "\n",
    "- This is a **real** dataset and so it may contain errors and other pecularities to work through\n",
    "- This dataset is ~218mb, which will take some time to load (and probably won't load in Google Sheets or Excel)\n",
    "- If you make assumptions, annotate them in your responses\n",
    "- While there is one code/markdown cell positioned after each question as a placeholder, some of your code/responses may require multiple cells\n",
    "- Double-click the markdown cells that say for example **1a answer here:** to enter your written answers. If you need more cells for your written answers, make them markdown cells (rather than code cells)\n",
    "- This homework assignment is not autograded because of the variety of responses one could give. \n",
    "  - Please upload this notebook to the autograder page and the TAs will manually grade it. \n",
    "  - Ensure that each cell is run and outputs your answer for ease of grading! \n",
    "  - Highly suggest to do a `restart & run all` before uploading your code to ensure everything runs and outputs correctly.\n",
    "  - Answers without code (or code that runs) will be given 0 points.\n",
    "- **This is meant to simulate real world data so you will have to do some external research to determine what some of the answers are!** "
